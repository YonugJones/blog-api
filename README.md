# blog-api
A blog that has a separate back and and two front ends

The goal of this project is to create a blog that allows the back end server to be used by two seaprate clients:
The admin front end and the user front end. 

The back end will not serve views. It will handle CRUD operations and expose ends points

The two front ends will help demonstrate the flexibility of the back end, improve security so the admin front end and user front end will not need the same authorization credentials, and allow for possible reusability for future applications. 

I hope that anyone taking the time to read this enjoys this application whether through learning something new, seeing how people are learning currently, or reminding yourself how far you've come since learning how to code. 

Thank you for checking this out :D
